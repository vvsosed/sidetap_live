"""Own the duck path, and be able to give the graph back.

Engaging unlinks the application from your speakers and routes it through a
loopback whose volume playout controls. That makes restoration a correctness
requirement rather than cleanup: a crash without it leaves the user with no
call audio and nothing on screen explaining why.

Every change is journalled to disk BEFORE it is made, so a kill -9 between the
two is recoverable. Journal entries name nodes by object.serial and ports by
name - never by port id, which PipeWire recycles.
