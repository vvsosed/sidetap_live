"""Real implementations of every port.

Every subprocess on the *audio path* is started here, behind a port, which is
what lets the rest of the package be tested against fakes with no hardware.

Two modules deliberately step outside that: `recorder.py`, which owns the
pw-record lifecycle it was split out to manage, and `doctor.py`, which probes
the environment before any port exists to inject. Neither is on the audio path,
and both are reached only from a command the user ran explicitly. Anything that
moves audio belongs here.
