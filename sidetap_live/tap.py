"""Link a matching application's audio into our capture node.

The tap itself is additive and never steals the stream: it only ever adds a
second link from the application's existing output ports into our capture
node, so PipeWire delivers an identical copy to us no matter what else those
ports are plugged into. Whether the application's original link to the
speakers survives is routing.py's call, not this module's - once engaged,
routing.py unlinks the application from the speakers and re-routes it through
a duck it controls, and this tap keeps tapping the same ports either way.

The watcher re-scans because applications create their audio streams late:
Zoom does it when the meeting starts, not when the app launches. Anything
that resolves nodes once at startup records silence. The same re-scan covers
reconnects when someone switches headphones mid-call.
