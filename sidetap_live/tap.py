"""Link a matching application's audio into our capture node.

The tap is additive: it adds a second link from the application's output
ports, so we get a copy whatever else they feed. Unlinking the speakers is
routing.py's job.

The watcher re-scans because applications create their streams late (Zoom
at meeting start, not app launch) and recreate them when devices change.
